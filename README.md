# parameter-passing-experiments
Team assignment for my Programming Language Concepts class


The assignment is as followed

You must submit a complete report that clearly shows:
1. Your code (screenshot in the report) — 10 points
2. Actual code extracted — 10 points
3. Explanation (in the report) — 10 points
4. Conclusion (final answer in the report) — 10 points
5. A table in your report clearly showing which questions and which parts of this
assignment were completed by you and your teammate


1. Write a program in a language that you know to determine the ratio of the time required to pass
a large array by reference and the time required to pass the same array by value. Make the array
as large as possible on the machine and implementation you use. Pass the array as many times
as necessary to get reasonably accurate timings of the passing operations.
2. Write a program, using the syntax of whatever language you like, that produces different
behavior depending on whether pass-by-reference or pass-by-value-result is used in its
parameter passing.
